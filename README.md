# Easalotti
Landing page for my FE web developer portfolio.
The site is not full adaptive as the template for adaptive layout was not provided.
The main goal of this work is to demonstrate my skills in using SASS, using flex & grid,
applying BEM methodology, linking 3-d party library, making animation.
